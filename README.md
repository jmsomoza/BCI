This is the repository of our capstone project for a Brain Computer Interface using EMG signals.

In the \software\eeg\APP folders you will find our source code for the project. It includes the 
circular buffer implementation and peak detection algorithm, as well as our bare-metal solution
in app.c.

Testcases for the peak detection algorithm are also provided in the test_peakfinder.c file

Cheers!
